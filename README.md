Telco Customer Churn Prediction – End-to-End ML Project

🚀 This repository documents my journey of building an end-to-end Machine Learning project to predict customer churn for a telecom company.

Currently, I have completed Phase 1: Project Setup & Planning.

🔹 Phase 1: Setup & Planning
📝 Step 1.1 – Understand the Business Problem

Churn definition: Customer churn refers to when a customer stops using a company’s services.

Why it matters: For telecom companies, churn directly impacts revenue. Acquiring a new customer is often more expensive than retaining an existing one.

Business need: If we can predict which customers are likely to churn, the company can take proactive actions (discounts, offers, better support) to retain them.

Output: Clear definition of churn and its business impact.

🎯 Step 1.2 – Define Goals & Metrics

Goal: Build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will churn.

Success criteria: Since churn datasets are usually imbalanced (fewer churners than non-churners), using accuracy alone is misleading.

Instead, we will focus on:

Recall (Sensitivity) → Catch as many churners as possible.

Precision → Ensure predictions are correct (avoid wasting offers on loyal customers).

F1-score → Balance between precision and recall.

ROC-AUC → Overall model quality across thresholds.

Output: Defined performance metrics (F1, ROC-AUC) to measure model success.


✅ Summary of Phase 1
Step	Task	Tools	Output
1.1	Understand the business problem	—	Defined churn and business impact
1.2	Define goals & metrics	—	Selected F1-score, Recall, Precision, ROC-AUC
1.3	Setup project folder	GitHub	Created /data, /notebooks, /streamlit, /powerbi
🎯 Next Steps

Phase 2: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (In Progress)

Load dataset and inspect data types.

Convert TotalCharges from object → numeric.

Handle missing/invalid values.

Encode categorical variables (label encoding/one-hot encoding).

Scale numerical features if necessary.

Output: Clean dataset ready for modeling.

⏳ Phase 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Univariate & bivariate analysis.

Visualize churn distribution across different features.

Identify correlations.

Export insights into Power BI dashboard.

Output: Business insights + churn patterns.

⏳ Phase 4: Model Building & Evaluation

Train/test split.

Baseline models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree.

Advanced models: Random Forest, XGBoost.

Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV.

Evaluate models using F1, Recall, ROC-AUC.

Output: Best performing model with metrics.

⏳ Phase 5: Model Explainability

Feature importance from models.

Use SHAP values to interpret predictions.

(Optional) LIME for local explanations.

Output: Transparent, explainable ML model.

⏳ Phase 6: Deployment

Build Streamlit app for predictions.

Integrate SHAP explanations into app.

Deploy on Hugging Face Spaces / Streamlit Cloud.

Output: Interactive churn prediction web app.

⏳ Phase 7: Power BI Dashboard

Import dataset into Power BI.

Build churn dashboard with slicers, KPIs, and charts.

Publish interactive dashboard online.

Output: Shareable churn insights dashboard.

⏳ Phase 8: Packaging & Documentation

Save trained model (.pkl file).

Write final project report.

Update README with results, screenshots, and links.

Finalize GitHub repo.
